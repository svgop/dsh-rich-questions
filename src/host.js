The full authoring doctrine lives in the rich-questions-authoring skill — load it before authoring any survey; this section is the operating minimum, and the tool descriptions repeat the bar at the moment you author.",
  "WHEN — 4+ questions, any branching (an answer decides what gets asked next), or options needing more than one sentence → ask_survey. 1-3 simple confirmations → ask_user_question. 10+ questions or research-backed work → the BUILDER loop, never one giant call: single-payload surveys are how shallow surveys happen.",
  "THE LOOP (research-first) — study 9-12 comparable systems BEFORE locking structure and write it down (findings → .docs/research/, digests → .docs/digest/, rips → .docs/research/rips/, source → .refs/ — unwritten research did not happen). begin the skeleton → enrich via op=patch (≤3 questions/call; patch also adds new ids and rewires .next; any op can read its payload from a workspace JSON file via file=) → survey_draft_get is the launch gate: checklist empty → survey_draft_launch.",
  "THE BAR (floor; the launch gate enforces it) — orienting intro (what this decides, why now, what happens with answers); self-contained prompts (every term defined in place); ≥5 stance-differentiated options per question (never filler, never “Option A”); insight rows naming a real-world proven use, the tradeoff, and a current-state handle; branch wherever an answer changes what follows; all user-facing copy in the user's chat language, option keys short ASCII.",
  "THE FEEL (handling the human) — when results return, open by restating the user's stance in one line (“You chose X over Y because Z, so I will…”); trace landed decisions back to their answers; NEVER re-ask what a survey or survey_records already answered; when an answer surprises you, ask why — a stated why is intent you can act on. Pre-flight picks (reroll/push/discuss) return with an instruction field — follow it.",
  "THE INSIGHT FORMAT (imitate this — one enriched option, from this plugin's own shipped survey) — insight is 3-5 markdown list rows, each led by a MEANINGFUL content label (Pattern / Proven at / Breaks when / Here now — labels vary with what the option needs; never a fixed generic triple). Worked: “- **Pattern:** ask-time memory injection — settled records are read at survey authoring, not at runtime.\n- **Proven at:** the context plugins resolve per-session data through provide contributions this way in production; survey_records (v0.3.0) already reads the settled store.\n- **Breaks when:** records outnumber relevance — fifty settled surveys later, injection needs ranking, not raw replay.\n- **Here now:** SurveyHostService.ask (src/host.js) has no injection seam; 2 settled records sit in ~/.dsh/rich-questions/surveys/ unread.” — four rows, four checkable claims: one names a real-world proven use (system + what happened), one states the tradeoff or break condition, one gives the current-state handle (file path / number / record). A one-word-label row (“Proven: X”) is as shallow as a paragraph. Sources on every option: file-level or product-level citations, not bare URLs.",
